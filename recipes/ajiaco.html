        <p>Ajiaco is one of the most delicious colombian dishes. In fact, it is my favorite. It is a soup flavoured mainly through a herb called guascas. It is eaten with avocado and cilantro. A beautiful video recipe can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOw1w-V3u_g">here</a>. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 large bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts</li>
                <li>1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped</li>
                <li>5 clove garlic, coarsely chopped</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of vegetal oil</li>
                <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
                <li>1 1/2 pounds mixed potatoes (ideally, criollas and pastusas (Yukon Potato)), peeled and cut into bite-size chunks</li>
                <li>2 to 3 medium ears corn, quartered, or 1 1/2 cups frozen corn kernels</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons dried guascas</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a heavy 4-quart lidded pot over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Add the chicken with the vegetables and brown each side</li>
                <li>Pour in the stock and raise the heat to high.</li>
                <li>When the mixture boils, lower the heat to medium-low then cover and simmer. Cook until the chicken is tender.</li>
                <li>Take the chicken aside and reserve the liquid. Then, when cold, cut the chicken into bite-size strips and discard the bones.</li>
                <li>Place the potatoes in the pot with the cooking liquid and turn the heat to medium, for at least five minutes</li>
                <li>Add the corn, cilantro and the guascas to the soup. Simmer, covered until potatoes are tender. Then put the chicken into the liquid.</li>
                <li>Wait until the chicken is warm and serve.</li>
            </ol>
